                <p>Participants also experienced great networking opportunities, and connected with sponsors and vendors in a reception and expo.

                <p>The event was, quite frankly, a success even beyond the hopes of its organizers. The 2012 Oklahoma City Young Professionals Energy Forum established the powerful demand for an event uniting the young professionals of our state's energy industry.

We are preparing an exciting line-up of speakers, networking opportunities, and sponsors, and look forward to seeing you in August at the 2013 Oklahoma Young Professionals Energy Forum!
